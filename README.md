# What's With All The Commits?
The reason as to why there are so many commits is that my partner, Victoria, could not connect
to the NAO or build on her computer, so it needed to all be done on mine. To do this,
I always had to commit before I merged incase anything went wrong, then I had
to pull her branch into mine and build from there. Often times, we needed to make small
changes just to see how changing a variable from 0.1 - 0.3 would affect how the robot responds, 
to do this Victoria would work on her computer, change a few things while I edited other things,
commit, merge, and build on mine. There are way too many commits, but this is the reason as to why.
