# CHANGES
Need to change the statepublihser to call services instead of publishing messages 
to make the code more fluid and better to understand. Right now the publisher
publishes a message as true and then waits for another node to publish it as false instead of
just waiting for a service to return

# What's With All The Commits?
The reason as to why there are so many commits is that my partner, Victoria, could not connect
to the NAO or build on her computer, so it needed to all be done on mine. To do this,
I always had to commit before I merged incase anything went wrong, then I had
to pull her branch into mine and build from there. Often times, we needed to make small
changes just to see how changing a variable from 0.1 - 0.3 would affect how the robot responds, 
to do this Victoria would work on her computer, change a few things while I edited other things,
commit, merge, and build on mine. There are way too many commits, but this is the reason as to why.

# WOW THIS CODE IS CRAP
Yes, we are aware that most of our code could be condensed and organized much better, but we are still newbies
in the computer science field. This stuff will come with time, and hopefully the code will look much 
better in the future.
